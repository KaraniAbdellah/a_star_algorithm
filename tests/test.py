# Try Implement the A* Algorithm

'''

    The a* algorithm need the heirstic graph (proposition)
        --> h(n) = node_level * 2
        --> node_level(n) is sum of all connect edges to n

    the algorithm use f(n)=g(n)+h(n) to find the shortest path
    g(n): The cost from the start node to the current node.
    h(n): The heuristic estimate from the current node to the goal.

    I need in implement to use:
        Graph, (Min-Heap), Set, Map
